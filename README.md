:zap:  **Frontend Tech Lead** from **Perù** that live in the beautiful city of **Milan**, with more than 10 years of experience :zap:

I started my career in the Tech field with .Net in a software house company and after 2 years I moved on the client side {{ Backend is the dark side :D }}. As a Frontend Developer I worked with different technologies like Html, Css and Javascript and frameworks / libraries like jQuery, Angular, React and StencilJS.
I love coding and learning new things about programming languages, frameworks and web / mobile development.

**Keep calm and code**
